TF2Center Notify
------------------------

A TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey script to add webkit/other notifications for ready up and messages containing nicknames.

It will probably have more features in the future, but for now it's pretty basic. Nicknames will be asked for when you load the script for the first time, soon I'll add a way to modify them.

To install, open "tf2center.user.js" and click the "Raw" button in the top right of the editor. Enabling requires you to click the "Notif" slider button under the "Filter" slider, and allowing notifications.
